My adventures with Philip's Hue system

Includes some python scripts I wrote for setting alarms, see [this post](http://rlamacraft.co.uk/projects/projectHugo-PartOne.html) on my website, and the code for the Hugo Hub website I coded ([this post](http://rlamacraft.co.uk/projects/projectHugo-PartTwo.html) for more information on that).
